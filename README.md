## Programming workflow
This section will tell you how what the process of adding new features to the repo is like.

2. You will assign yourself to that issue and move the issue into the `In Progress` column in <a href="https://github.com/Andreasgdp/Robot-hand-semester-2/projects/2" target="_blank">Project Planning</a>
   1. A branch will be created with the issue number and name of the issue.
3. You are to work on your feature on that specific branch and **NOT on the `master branch`**
4. When done with your feature, you will have to create a Pull Request (PR). You can do that <a href="https://github.com/Andreasgdp/Robot-hand-semester-2/compare" target="_blank">here</a>
   1. After creating a pull request you can assign another person to review your code and then accept it.
